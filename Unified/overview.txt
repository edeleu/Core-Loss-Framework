Overview of files:

UnifiedSingle was the original implementation of the unified approach for a single material.
TrainUnified is the code to train/evaluate the unified model with the currently optimal model setup. 
This file has a majority of the comments and should be used as reference. The LSTM is based off off
this code as a template. 


TrainLSTM is the code to train the LSTM unified model
OptimizeUnified / LSTM optimize the LSTM or transformer approaches using Optuna, optimizing all model setup
countParams counts the number of parameters for a given NN structure
LRExperiments includes some experimentation with linear warmup and COS annealing LR with restarts

Some example slurm scripts are also included.

Note, all of the file paths and names likely need to be modified for using these scripts.
